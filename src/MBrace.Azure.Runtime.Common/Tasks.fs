module Nessos.MBrace.Azure.Runtime.Tasks

// Provides facility for the execution of tasks.
// In this context, a task denotes a single work item to be sent
// to a worker node for execution. Tasks may span multiple threads
// but are bound to a single process. A cloud workflow that has
// been passed continuations is a typical example of such a task.

// Tasks are cloud workflows that have been attached to continuations.
// In that sense they are 'closed' multi-threaded computations that
// are difficult to reason about from a worker node's point of view.
// TaskExecutionMonitor provides a way to cooperatively track execution
// of such 'closed' computations.
